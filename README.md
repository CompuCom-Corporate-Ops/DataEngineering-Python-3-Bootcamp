# DataEngineering-DataEngineering-Python-3-Bootcamp
These are the topics we are going to be covering during our lectures, all the code will be posted at the beginning of the lectures, for simplicity the code will be uploaded in a jupyter notebook format, therefore installing Anaconda is highly recommended. 

## Getting Started
To open any file first open up a jupyter notebook 

### 1.- Installing the requirements
The code contains the requirements.txt, create a virtual env using this file before attempting to execute it. Once cloned, cd over the new directory.

```sh
$ git clone ~/DataEngineering-Python-3-Bootcamp.git

```
